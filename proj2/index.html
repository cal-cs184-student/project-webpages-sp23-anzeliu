        <h1 align="middle">Overview</h1>

        <p>In Project 2 MeshEdit, I explored geometric modeling by using the de Casteljau algorithm to build Bezier curves and surfaces, computing the area-weighted vertex normals to enable Phong shading, flipping and splitting edges of triangle meshes represented
            by half-edge data structure, and implementing loop subdivision as a upsampling method for 3D meshes. Starting with the de Casteljau algorithm, given n control points and a parameter t that defines the a Bezier curve and where it will be evaluated,
            respectively, we can linearly interpolate every two consecutive control/intermediate points to reach the next level of subdivision. The final single point would be the point on Bezier curve at parameter t. Extending this algorithm to build
            Bezier surface, given a 2-dimensional vector of control points consisting of rows and columns, we evaluate the final point on Bezier curve for each of the rows of control points at parameter u, followed by evaluating the final point with the
            newly found rowsâ€™ Bezier curve points at parameter v. Concluding the section on Bezier Curves and Surfaces, we now move on to Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure. To enable Phong shading so that the brightness of triangle meshes transitions
            from one degree to another smoothly, we compute the area-weighted vertex normals. Based on the half-edge data structure representation of triangle meshes, we can manipulate the halfedges, vertices, edges, and faces elements to achieve Edge
            Flip and Edge Split. Finally, I implemented loop subdivision to upsample 3D meshes by computing the new positions for old and new vertices of a given mesh, split all old edges, flip newly created edges from split operation if they connect
            a new vertex to an old vertex, and update the position member of each vertex using the precomputed new positions. At the end of the project, we are able to enable Phong shading, modify edges, and upsample meshes. Interestingly, multiple loop
            subdivision on the cube mesh would result in asymmetry due to corner vertices having different vertex degree. This problem is explored in detail later in the project.

        <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h2>

        <h3>Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.</h3>
        <p>In de Casteljau's algorithm, we are given n control points and a parameter t, where the former defines a Bezier curve and the latter determines where the Bezier curve will be evaluated. Every two consecutive control points are linearly interpolated
            at t, which result in n - 1 intermediate points, defining the next subdivision level. Recursively repeat the above step until there is only one point, which lies on the Bezier curve at parameter t. To implement de Casteljau's algorithm, a
            lerp function is first implemented to abstract away the linear interpolation. In BezierCurve::evaluateStep, which computes one level of subdivision, if the input vector, points, has only one point, then it is the point on the Bezier curve
            at param t, points would be returned. Otherwise, a new vector of Vector2D points is initialized to be intermediate_points, which would store the n - 1 intermediate points of the next subdivision level. Iterating through every point in the
            vector points, compute the linear interpolation between every two consecutive points, from which the result of lerp is pushed back to the vector intermediate_points. Once the loop completes, intermediate_points is returned as the output of
            BezierCurve::evaluateStep.

        <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h2>

        <h3>Briefly explain how the de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.</h3>
        <p>The de Casteljau's algorithm extends to Bezier surface by evaluating the final point on Bezier curve for each of the rows of control points at parameter u, followed by evaluating the final point with the newly found rowsâ€™ Bezier curve points at
            parameter v. More specifically, to extend de Casteljau's algorithm to evaluate Bezier surfaces, a lerp function that linearly interpolates two 3-dimensional vectors with a parameter is implemented to abstract away the calculation. Next, BezierPatch::evaluateStep
            is implemented with the same functionality as BezierCurve::evaluateStep but for Vector3D. BezierPatch::evaluate1D repeatedly calls BezierPatch::evaluateStep until evaluateStep returns a vector of size 1, containing only the final point on
            the Bezier curve. Finally, in BezierPatch::evaluate, iterate through every row of controlPoints, which is a n x n grid of original control points, and compute the final single point on the Bezier curve defined by each row of n control points
            at parameter u. The final single points from all the rows are stored in a vector called rows_final_point. Call BezierPatch::evaluate1D with rows_final_point and parameter v as inputs, resulting in the final single point that lies on the Bezier
            surface at parameter u and v. The Bezier surface is, therefore, evaluated.

            <li>Initialize a HalfedgeCIter variable h, the halfedge of current vertex</li>
            <li>Find all the neighbor vertices of the current vertex instance, which can be iteratively found in a doâ€¦ while loop by locating the next neighbor vertex as follows:</li>

        <p>As shown from the rendered teapot, with flat shading, the edge lines appear sharp, whereas with Phong shading, the shading smoothly transitions from brighter to darker areas. Vertex normal is the vector perpendicular to the surface tangent at
            a vertex of a triangle. The brightness of a point on the surface of the teapot depends on the direction of the normal vector, which in turn defines the orientation of the vertex with respect to the light. By computing the sum of the area-weighted
            normals of neighboring triangles, we take in consideration the orientation of the neighboring triangle surface, therefore leading to a smooth transition from one triangle to another. By normalizing the sum of normals, we eliminate the effect
            of the magnitude of each element in the 3D vector to the resulting vertex normal and to ensure that the vertex normal is a unit vector. In general, the teapot with vertex normals has the brightness smoothly change from one degree to another,
            whereas in the teapot without vertex normals, neighboring triangles have more distinct brightness. </p>


        <h2 align="middle">Part 4: Edge flip</h2>
        <h3>Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.</h3>

        <p>To implement the edge flip operation, first draw out all the elements: faces, halfedges, edges and vertices, on a triangle as follows:</p>

        <div align="middle"><img src="images/part4/before_flip_diagram.png" align="middle" width="700px" /></div>

        <p>Based on the labeled elements, initialize variables with the same name as the above labels and set them to the corresponding VertexIter, HalfedgeIter, EdgeIter, and VertexIter by calling halfedge(), next(), vertex(), face(), edge(), and twin()
            from the proper elements. </p>

        <p> Once all the elements have been set to their proper variables, I drew a diagram similar to the above but with the edge flipped and all elements reassigned to their new positions, shown as follows:</p>

        <p>Following this diagram with the flipped edge, I reassigned all the elements that require a change.</p>
        <p>In addition, before initializing all the variables with the same name as the labels, e0 is checked for whether it is on the boundary or not. If it is a boundary edge, then e0 is immediately returned.</p>

        <p>When I first compiled my code and tested the edges with the flip F key, I realized that the edge is flipped but some other edges are missing. However, I did not delete any edges. After examining my code carefully, I pointed out that the halfedge
            element of each of the edges is not reassigned and the twin element of each of the halfedges on the exterior of the two triangles in the diagram is not reassigned either. After adding these two sets of reassignment, the flip functions correctly.</p>

        <p>Base on this diagram, I initialize variables with the same name as the above labels and set them to the corresponding VertexIter, HalfedgeIter, EdgeIter, and VertexIter by calling halfedge(), next(), vertex(), face(), edge(), and twin() from the
            proper elements. </p>

        <p>Once all the elements have been set to their proper variables, I drew a diagram to show what the triangles would look like after the slip operation, with modified and newly added halfedges, vertices, edges, and faces, shown as follows:</p>
        <div align="middle"><img src="images/part5/after_split_diagram.png" align="middle" width="700px" /></div>

        <div align="left"><img src="images/part5/changes.png" align="middle" width="920px" /></div>

        <p>Continuing to follow the diagram, I reassigned elements for all halfedges, vertices, faces, edges, as well as the twins labeled t1, t2, t3, t4, which are halfedges on the exterior of triangles.</p>

        <p>In addition, similar to part 4 - edge flip, before initializing all the variables with the same name as the labels, e0 is checked for whether it is on the boundary or not. If it is a boundary edge, then VertexIter() is immediately returned. </p>

        <p>Finally, vertex m is returned if e0 is not a boundary edge and all the reassignments are complete. </p>

        <h2 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling </h2>

        <h3>Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.</h3>

        <p>Loop subdivision is a mesh upsampling method that first subdivides a triangle into four smaller triangles followed by updating the positions of the vertices with a weighing scheme. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Compute the new positions for all the old vertices in the input mesh</li>
            <div align="middle"><img src="images/part6/step1.png" align="middle" width="980px" /></div>
            <li>Compute the position for new vertices, which are at the midpoint of every original edge</li>
            <div align="middle"><img src="images/part6/step2.png" align="middle" width="980px" /></div>
            <li>Split every old edge in the mesh by iterating over the edges of the original mesh</li>
            <div align="middle"><img src="images/part6/step3.png" align="middle" width="980px" /></div>
            <li>Flip any newly added edges that connects a new vertex with an old vertex</li>
            <div align="middle"><img src="images/part6/step4.png" align="middle" width="980px" /></div>
            <li>Copy the computed new vertex position into the final Vertex::position</li>
            <div align="middle"><img src="images/part6/step5.png" align="middle" width="980px" /></div>
        </ol>

        <p>In summary, loop subdivision is implemented by calculating and storing the new positions for old and new vertices, split every old edges, flip newly created edges if it has both a new and an old vertex, and update the position member of every
            vertex with new position.</p>

        <h3>Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?</h3>
        <p>After each loop subdivision, sharp corners and edges are more rounded as those corner edges get splitted and repositioned with the weighing scheme. For example, as we perform loop subdivision repeatedly on the torus, the hexagon shape becomes
            circular. Similarly, as we perform loop subdivision repeatedly on the icosahedron, it becomes more like a sphere, losing its original sharp corners. This effect can be reduced by pre-splitting the edges so that the vertex degree of each of
            the corner vertices is the same.</p>

        <p>As shown from the rendered images, the cube becomes asymmetrical after repeated subdivisions. From the current camera perspective, the bottom left corner and the top right corner of the cube seem to have been extended further out than the top
            left corner and bottom right corner. To subdivide the cube symmetrically, we need to preprocess with the following steps.</p>

        <h3> Preprocessing </h3>
        <p> First splitting the edge across each of the 6 square sides of the cube, as follows:</p>

        <h3>Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.</h3>

        <p>The asymmetrical effect from loop subdivision is due to the different vertex degree of the corner vertices. The cube has diagonal edges on each of its 6 square sides. As shown from teh image below, when viewing the cube from one particular perspective,
            some diagonal edges connects top left vertex to the bottom right vertex of the square face, whereas other diagonal edges connects top right vertex to the bottom left vertex. As a result, the corner vertices have different degrees: 3, 4, 5,
            or 6. With different vertex degree, the new positions of the corner vertices would have slightly different weighing scheme.
        </p>

        <div align="middle">
            <img src="images/part6/degree.png" align="middle" width="1000px" />
        </div>

        <p>Assuming the same corner vertex, thus same vposition and old_neighbor_position_sum, the new position if vertex has degree 6 would be smaller than the new position if the vertex has degree 4. This results in the vertex with degree 6 being more
            rounded off, closer to the origin, than the vertex with degree 4. Consequently, with corner vertices having different degrees, the amounts of position change from their original position to new position are slightly different for every loop
            subdivision. Eventually the cube appears asymmetrical with multiple loop subdivisions.
        </p>

        <p>To resolve this problem, we can proprocess the mesh by splitting the edges that goes across diagonally on each of the 6 faces of the cube. This would that all the 8 corner vertices of the cube have the same vertex degree of 6, thus the amount
            of change from their original position to the new position would be the same. As the corner vertices get updated the same amount, the cube after multiple loop subdivisions would still be symmetrical. Overall, the preprocessing that prevent
            asymmetry from loop subdivisions is splitting edges such that the corner vertices that defines the general shape of the object have the same number of vertex degree because the vertex degree determines to what extent a vertex is moved from
            their original position to its new position.
